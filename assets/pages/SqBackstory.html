                The Abyssal Hunters, sometimes simply known as the Abyssal,
                <br> 
                is an organization in Arknights whose mission is
                to keep the sea monsters in check from their invasion of land.
                <br>
                Their eerie background makes them both mysterious
                and dangerous to the land-dwellers of Terra.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-box" style="width: 68%; margin-left: 20px; float: left;">
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">
                    Abyssal Hunters possess an unusually high physical strength, endurance and speed, far surpassing regular Terrans. 
                    <br>
                    Their physical and psychological engineering is necessary to withstand the Seaborn's might and horror. They exclusively use "primitive" melee weapons to emphasize their physical prowess as well as preventing their enemies from evolving countermeasures against their advanced technologies. 
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">
                    On the other hand, their Seaborn blood can take over the Hunter's Aegir blood if it is left unchecked, which could lead to their transformation into the monsters they hate.
                    <br>
                    Symptoms of such transformation include unawareness of their surroundings, loss of conscience, and Seaborn scales occupying their bodies.
